# Stress_Ball
This is a fun and interactive web project that simulates a draggable and bouncy stress ball using JavaScript and the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library. You can drag and release the ball to watch it bounce, spin, and squash on impact. The project also supports theme switching between different types of balls.
